Setting up a development installation
======================================

-----------------------------
Before jumping into the code
-----------------------------

DIRAC source code is maintained in GIT distributed code management system. It is highly recommended to be familiar with with GIT 
before jumping into the code development. Please, go through a GIT tutorial. The recommended ones are:

 - For an GIT shallow overview the GIT community book at http://book.git-scm.com/ . 
   Do not be alarmed by the word *book*. It's more a tutorial on the basics of GIT. 
 - For really knowing what's going on read http://progit.org/book/ . It'll make using GIT a painless and nice experience.
 
-------------------------------------
Sharing your development
------------------------------------- 
 
Once you're familiar with the basics of how GIT works. You're ready to clone the DIRAC source repository. 
DIRAC repository is hosted at https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC . From there you have two options:

 - Easy way: 
 
  1. Register at *github.com* and set up your account
  2. On *github.com* fork the DIRAC repository by going to https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC and clicking the *Fork* button on 
     the top right part of the page.
  3. By forking a repository *github.com* will create a https://github.com/yourusername/DIRAC repository where you are the administrator.
  4. Clone that repository in your local work space
  5. Start working on the DIRAC code
  6. Push changes to your *github.com* repository
  7. Issue a pull request to DIRAC by going to https://github.com/yourusername/DIRAC, switching to the branch you want DIRAC to 
     pull changes from and clicking the pull request button. 
  
-------------------------------------------
Setting up your development installation
-------------------------------------------

DIRAC developers tend to use eclipse for developing DIRAC. It is not mandatory but it is recommended. The following steps 
will try to guide you on setting up a development installation for DIRAC in eclipse. If you don't need/want eclipse just 
follow the next section and skip the rest.

Checking out the source
=========================

First you need to check out all the sources you need to start working on DIRAC or on any extension. Go to a clean directory 
( from now on we will call that directory *devRoot* ) and:
 
 1. Go to your *devRoot* directory
 2. Check out DIRAC source code. DIRAC source is hosted on *github.com*. So, you have to do::
      
      git clone git@github.com:yourusername/DIRAC.git 
     
    This will create a *devRoot/DIRAC* for you.
      
    If you don't intend to develop DIRAC and just need it for developing extensions do::
     
      git clone https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC.git
 
 3. This will create a *remote* pointer ( in git terms ) in the local git repository called *origin* that points to your source repository. 
    In that repository you will publish your code to be released. But all the releases will be done in the 
    https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC repository. 
    You need to define a *remote* for that repository to be able to pull newly released changes into your working repo. 
    We will name that repository *upstream*::

     git remote add upstream https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC.git  
     git fetch upstream                                          
  
 4. If you need DIRACWeb extension, for example, do the same with the repo at https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRACWeb
 5. If you need to check out any extension do so in the *devRoot* directory. For instance::
 
       svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/dirac/LHCbDIRAC/trunk/LHCbDIRAC LHCbDIRAC
 
 6. Repeat step 4 for each extension you need
 7. Deploy DIRAC scripts by running::
 
       DIRAC/Core/scripts/dirac-deploy-scripts.py

 8. Get the DIRAC External binaries for you platform by running::
 
       scripts/dirac-install -X -t server -i 26
    
    This may take a while if there aren't externals available for your platform and they have to be compiled.
 9. Configure DIRAC by executing::
 
       scripts/dirac-configure -S setupyouwanttorun -C configurationserverslist -n sitename -H

 10. From now on, every time you want to publish something to your public repository do::

       git push origin localbranch:remotebranch  
       
     if you want to push a new branch
  
     or just::

       git push origin 
       
     for an already pushed branch

 11. To bring changes from the release repository do::

       git fetch upstream
       git rebase upstream/integration
 
You're ready for DIRAC development !

Configuring *Eclipse*
=======================

Two extensions are required for developing DIRAC with *Eclipse*. To install them go to 
*Help->Install new software->top right button "Add..." -> Insert name and URL* and then select the software to install in the list.

 - *pyDev* : Use http://pydev.org/updates as the URL to install from. For more info go to http://pydev.org/updates
 - *EGit* : Git team provider for eclipse. Use http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates as the URL. 
   For more info go to http://www.eclipse.org/egit/
 
Now you need to configure the *pyDev* plugin. Go to *Window->Preferences* (*Eclipse->preferences* if you're in a MacOSX box). 
In the preferences pane go to *Pydev->Editor*, select 2 as the tab length and click "Replace tabs with spaces when typing". 
In *Pydev->Editor->Code Style->Code formatter* check all the boxes. 
 
For *EGit* you simply need to configure your name and mail. Go to the preferences pane and then go to 
*Team->Git->Configuration* and add two entries: *user.name* with your name and *user.email* with your email.

That's it! *Eclipse* is configured now :)


Creating a development installation in Eclipse
=================================================

All that remains is to import these directories as projects in Eclipse. To import DIRAC:

 1. File -> Import...
 2. Git -> Projects from Git and click *Next*.
 3. In the "Import Projects from Git" click *Add*.
 4. In the "Add Git Repositories", click *Browse* and select the DIRAC source code folder you cloned into before. Then click *Search* and the *.git* directory in the DIRAC source code directory should appear. Select it and click *OK*.
 5. In the "Import Projects from Git" pane the DIRAC folder should now appear. Select it and click *Next*.

Create as a general project

 6. Select "Import as General Project" and click *Next*.
 7. In the "Import Project from Git" write the project name of your Workspace and then click *Finish*.

Create as a pydev project (may not work in all versions of eclipse/pydev)

 6. Select "Use the New Project wizard" and click *Finish*.
 7. In the *New Project* wizard choose *Pydev -> Pydev project* and click *Next*.
 8. Choose the necessary settings for the project, in particular:
 
    - Project name, e.g. DIRAC_dev
    - The project working directory
    - Use Python 2.6 grammar
    - Choose the python interpreter ( you might need to set it up in a separate form )
    - Uncheck creation of *src* directory
    
 9. Click *Finish*.   
 
If you want to add DIRACWeb to eclipse repeat the same steps with the Web source directory. For additional extensions, add them as projects to Eclipse. You'll have to look on how to do it depending on your team provider. For instance, if you are using subversion for your extension:

 1. Go to the *SVN Repository Exploring* exploring perspective
 2. In the *SVN repositories* panel, right click -> New -> Repository Location and fill in the details for your repository
 3. Once the repository appears in the *SVN repositories* panel, browse it until you find the extension directory.
 4. Once you find the extension directory -> right click -> Find/Check out as...
 5. Select *Check out as project with the name specified* and fill in the extension name (name ending with DIRAC). For instance LHCbDIRAC
 6. Click next
 7. Uncheck *Use default workspace location* and browse to the directory where DIRAC is installed. If DIRAC is in */some/path/DIRAC*, select */some/path*
 8. Click finish

That's it! You have a nice development installation set up :)
 
 
Setting up a working set for the DIRAC workspace
--------------------------------------------------

Eclipse can manage several projects and developers may need have more than one development installation. It is useful to set up a view per installation. To define different views for each installation we will use Eclipse's *working sets*. A *working set* is nothing more than a group of projects. By defining a *working set* Eclipse can hide the rest of the projects so only the projects in the current *working set* are shown. To define a *working set*:

 1. Click on the small arrow on the package explorer and then on *Select working set...*
 
 .. image:: images/workingsets-01.png
  :align: center
  
 2. Click on *New...* and then selecte *Resource* and then click *Next>*
 
 .. image:: images/workingsets-02.png
  :align: center
  
 3. Give it a meaningful name and select all the projects you want to include in the *working set* and click *Finish*
 
 .. image:: images/workingsets-03.png
  :align: center
  
 4. Now the new working set will appear. If you want to activate it just select it and click *OK*
 
 .. image:: images/workingsets-04.png
  :align: center
 
Now, to change the active working set or to disable them:

 1. Click again on the small arrow on the package explorer and then on *Select working set...* as before
 2. Select the working set you want to activate or select *No working sets* to deactivate them
